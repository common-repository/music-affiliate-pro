Search for music, insert links, embed widgets, and add affiliate tags at the click of a button--without leaving your dashboard!

== Description ==

Music Affiliate Pro will turn you into a music linking ninja. Overnight. Guaranteed. Well, maybe not quite that fast. You do have to jump through a few hoops to register for the various affiliate networks and web services, but if you write about music often and want to make a few bucks in the process, the time savings are more than worth it.

#### Features
* Search major digital music outlets in seconds, including iTunes, Amazon MP3, Spotify, Rdio, and eMusic.
* Quickly insert links into your content directly from the *Tune Search* search results. You don't have to leave your dashboard or switch browser tabs.
* Just as easily add widgets from Spotify, iTunes, Rdio, and Amazon MP3.
* Automatically add affiliate tags to your links. Even works on older links!
* Earn money writing about music! What could be cooler than that?

We ask that you contribute a percentage of your link impressions for us to help cover time and costs for development, but it's not a requirement and you have the ability to change exactly how often our affiliate info will appear.

*Note that at this time, we only support US based affiliate networks and retailers. Support for affiliate networks is currently limited to Amazon and iTunes.*

== Installation ==

Installing Music Affiliate Pro is just like installing most other plugins. [Check out the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) if you have any questions.

#### Setup
iTunes and Spotify don't currently require any further setup unless you'd like to join the iTunes affiliate program (Spotify doesn't offer one). To search Amazon MP3, Rdio, and eMusic, you'll need to register for their respective web services and affiliate programs. Additional info is provided in the settings panel.
